    </div><br>
    <p style="color:black;">Raster graphics, a type of digital image that uses tiny rectangular pixeles or picture element, arranged in a grid formation to represnt an image. </p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:black;">Vector graphics, composed of lines defined by mathematical formulas, the vector graphics were used because the memory that would be needed for displaying raster graphics or bit mapped graphics.</p>

        <h2><FONT COLOR ="teal">1.Raster Graphics:-GIMP</FONT></h2>
    </div>
    <p style="color:black;">GIMP is an acronym for GNU image manipulation program. It is a freely distributed program for such tasks as photo retouching , image composition and image authoring.<br> 
    I used GIMP for converting my own Photo into pencil sketch </p>
    <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A03.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
    <br>
    <p style="color:black;">Firstly open the GIMP software <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A02.png" alt="Image"></center> </p>
    <p style="color: black;">bring in this jpeg image in this example we'll bring it into go over to the layers and click this duplicate icon and we'll duplicate so that we have three differnt layers of exact same image. <br>
    And then we have our first layer selected, we'll just go up to colours and then go down to hue saturation and we're going to take the color out of this layer, So we'll go down here to saturation and we'll just make sure we drag this all the way down so there is no color we've taken all the color saturation out of the image then we'll click ok to apply those changes so we have a nice black and white image. <br>
    we'll go to mode and then we're going to change the way that it's overlaid with the other layers we'll chnage it to hsv saturation.</p>
    <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A04.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">Now we'll click on this middle layer the layer right below and then we'll want to go up to filters and go to Blur and we'll do a gaussian Blur so it,s just going to blur the image and we'll set the x and y, you can adjust it depending on your image we'll put this up to 7.5 and so you'll go for about this amount of blur again you can change any of these steps that you want to fill your image and then we're goning to go to colors and we'll go down to value invert , Now we're goning to change the mode on it as well from normal and we'll go down to dodge.</p>
    <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A05.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">Now we,re shining through to this very last image so we'll select the last layer here and we'll go to colors and in this case we,re just going to adjust the contrast just a little bit we're going to go levels and we're going to just make it a littel bit lighter in contarst you can do it by clicking the little dial in the middle or by just adjusting the numbers manually click on ok,<br>
    now go to the top layer and just click over here in the layers and go to new from visible and that's going to create a new layer merging everything together from what we just saw and so whatever we were looking at visibly it created all in one layer so we can turn off these three layers and we'll still see just this image without this way we'll be able to apply changes just to this single layer now without having to worry about the other ones, <br>
    So we're going to go up here to filters and let's go to distort and we'll do emboss and just do the setting, adjust the elevation, depth and try to achive the kind of pencil shade, lastly we can go to colors and levels one more time on the entire al the images we'll just change the contrast and after clickingon ok we'll get the final image.</p>

        <h2><FONT COLOR ="teal">2.Vector Graphics:- CorelDraw </FONT></h2>
    </div>
    <p style="color:black;">Coreldraw is a vector graphics editor developed and marketed by alludo. it is also the name of the Corel graphics suite, which includes the bitmap-image editor Corel photo-paint as well as other graphics related program.<br>
    i have used Coreldraw Graphics suite X7 for image processing. Using this software, I have transformed a regular image into one suitable for laser engraving.</p>
    <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A07.JPG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">This is the interface of CorelDraw software. click on file and create a new Document. I used image of my favourite character From marval.</p>
    <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A08.JPG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">By right clicking on workspace or by using Ctrl+i key import your jpeg image.</p>
    <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A09.JPG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">Then go to Bitmaps tab, select mode and select Grayscale(8-bit) after this you can see your original image become Black and white.</p>
    <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A10.JPG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">Again go to Bitmaps tab, select mode and select Black and White(1-bit) as shown in image and export the file with BMP extenstion.</p>

        <h2><FONT COLOR ="teal">3.AutoCad</FONT></h2>
    </div>
    <p style="color:black;">AutoCad software basically used for designing 2D drawings. this is the interface of AutoCad softwear.</p>
        <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A12.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">    
            Today I design 2D drawing and also add the construction geometries, Dimensions.<br>
        Very first thing in AutoCad is that you need do is set your units. I Draw this drawing in millimeters so for that I,ll just go to UN I'll just type it I'll press enter and the drawing unit window will show up here I'll select decimal for precision I'll select only one decimal place because if you look Dimensions it's just one decimal place and same for angle and insertion scale I selected millimeter and click OK.  
    </p>
        <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A13.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
        <p style="color:black;">
            Now I'll go to line tool and click at a point and make a line and make a length of 12mm and enter. I want to draw two concentric circles now so I'll go to circle and click on one end of line and make a circle of radius 1.4 and repeat this and this time I'll make it of diameter 5.6, i want to copies of this two circles on other end of line also so instead of making it again I'll just copy these two and paste it on other end of line, I've got the concentric circles.
        </p>
            <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A14.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
        <p style="color:black;">
            Now i need the radius of 12 which is connecting these two and in this case the circle or the arc should be tangent so I'll use tangent tangent radius circle for this now clickon the first outer circle and then second outer circle and then give the radius of 12 and enter, Now I'll go to trim tool and trim the unused part from the circle. 
        </p>
            <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A15.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
        <p style="color:black;">
            Now i need one more line of 8mm for that again select line command go to midpoint of middle line and make line of length 8mm, After this I'll go to offset and by using offset distance of 3.5 and enter and now I'll select the line and make offset towards left and right both the side now add one more line to join both offset lines, And after this delete the unwanted construction geometries. 
        </p>
            <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A16.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
        <p style="color:black;">
           I want to add fillet now so I'll go to fillet and select the radius of 2mm and also select this multiple option because i want to repeat this so I'll select the line and circle and it's applied and also since i selected multiple option the fillet command is still active and now I'll do it same fillet on other side so it's applied now go to radius again and change the radius to 1mm again I'll click on multiple because i want to apply fillet multiple so i select edges that i want to fillet. 
        </p>
            <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A17.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
        <p style="color:black;">
            Now i want to add one fileted rectangle right in the middle of two circles. I make the reactangle outside the my plan and draw one reactangle of length 3mm and width 7mm and enter now add fillet of radius 1mm, This time i want to add fillet on all 4 sides of reactangle so i select polyline option and click on enter.<br>
            for moving that object select move tool select object and press enter and move to the mid-point of line and then again move it upwards and now we are done with basic geometry part.
        </p>
            <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A18.PNG" alt="Image"></center> 
        <p style="color:black;">
            Now it's time to add construction geometries, Go to annotate tab and start by adding the centerline so I'll go to the centerline option by selecting the two lines I'll add centerline. You can also move that centerline up and down.<br>
             Now let's add centermark select centermark and select circle my centermark is added. 
            <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A19.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
        <p style="color:black;">
            Let's add construction line, go to home tab and select the line tool and make a construction geometry now we have to create this line into construction line, Go to property panel and from this drop-down select the centerline and it's applied.
        </p>
            <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A20.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
        <p style="color:black;">
            For adding the Dimensions go to the Dimensions tab and give all the Dimensions. 
        </p>
            <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A21.PNG" alt="Image"></center> 
        <p style="color:black;">
            We can put this object into differnt layers for that go to layer properties and just create new one layer for dimentions and create one more for construction you can also chnage the color of layer and also transperncy we can change. Now select all the dimentions and select layer that i created for dimentions same for construction. 
        </p>

        <h1><FONT COLOR ="teal">3D Design</FONT></h1>
    </div>
    <p style="color:black;">
        In 3D designing softwear i explore Fusion 360 and SolidWorks by using this Software we can Draw or design anything that I want. there are differnt parts in SolidWorks using that I can simulate our design and watch how exactly my model work. 
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <div class="text-center">
        <h2><FONT COLOR ="teal">1.Fusion 360</FONT></h2>
    </div>
    <p style="color:black;">
        First i have created my account on offical website of Autodesk and from there I got offical version of Fusion 360. Now open the fusion 360 and select the plan for drawing. <br>
        Then I draw square of 60 units and inside that square draw one more square of 40 units then select the inner square of drawing and by right clicking on it move it towards upward by 100 units.
    </p>
        <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A23.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">
        Now connect upper square and lower square by line command as shown in image.<br>
        Go drop-down to the CREATE list and select LOFT command and select upper and lower square as two profile, And then i select the four lines that connects the two plans as a Rails and click on ok.
    </p>
        <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A24.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">
        Then I select the SHELL and select the upper layer of drawing and made a shell then offset both the plan by 4 units.
    </p>
        <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A25.PNG" alt="Image"></center> 
    <p style="color:black;">
        Now I'll go to drop-down of the Modify and slect the SPLIT body and by selecting both the upper and lower make 2 bodies.
    </p>
        <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A26.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">
        Again by selecting LOFT command trun four side into four bodies and then just rename all the bodies.  
    </p>
        <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A27.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">
        Select the top, middle and bottom of the bodies and COMBINE the three bodies. Do this same for four side of the drawings. 
    </p>
        <center><img class="w-50" src="img/WEEK2/A28.PNG" alt="Image"></center>
    <p style="color:black;">
        After this I got one Problem with Voronoi-Sketch editor.<br>
        this sketch editor is only apply to 2 axis plan and i want to apply it on all the three axis.
    </p>
